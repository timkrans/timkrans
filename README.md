##  Featured Projects

### **macOS Command Agent (Go)** 
Built a CLI tool using AI to convert natural language into safe macOS commands. 
- Integrated with local/remote LLMs, enforced command whitelisting, and implemented a custom .env loader and test suite.
- Integrated with AI services (Ollama, Hugging Face, local models) for natural language command interpretation
- Whitelisted and sandboxed over 40 macOS commands to prevent dangerous execution (e.g., sudo, rm -rf /)
- Designed a JSON-based AI-to-agent interface with command reasoning, confidence scoring, and explanations

### **Neural Network Implementation**
A custom neural network implementation in **C++** from scratch:
- Backpropagation algorithm for training
- Sigmoid activation functions and derivatives
- Model persistence and loading capabilities
- Mathematical operations learning (addition)
- Memory-efficient design with custom weight initialization
- Real-time training and inference capabilities

### **AI-Powered Crypto Trading Bot**
A machine learning-powered cryptocurrency analysis tool in **Python**:
- Technical indicator analysis (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, OBV)
- Random Forest classification for price prediction
- Real-time data fetching with yfinance API
- Performance metrics and confusion matrix analysis
- Support for multiple cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing

### **Web Portfolio**
A web portfolio implemented in Angular:
- Dynamic Routing & Lazy Loading: Improved performance and navigation efficiency.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Contact Form Integration: Real-time form validation with reactive forms and integration.
